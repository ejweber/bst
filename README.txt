This implementation of a binary search tree was written in Java to fulfill a requirement for CS 721 
at Wichita State University. It is intended to be compiled and run on the Computer Science 
Department's McCoy server, which (for some unknown reason) runs javac and java version 1.6.0_38 in 
the year 2018. It has only been tested in this environment. 

To compile and run the code:
	Unzip bst.zip.
	Navigate to the top level directory (<path>/bst/) where makefile, src/, and test/ should exist.
	Type "make".
	The java compiler should create a new main/ director with .class files inside of it.
	Type "java main.Assignment".
	
Following the instructions above drops the user into an command line interface through which he can 
interact with an initially empty tree.
